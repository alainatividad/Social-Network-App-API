# E-commnerce Back End

## Description

This application is an Express.js API that interacts with MongoDB that serves as a back end for an social networking site where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

### Database Models

The database contains the following models:

**User**:

- `username`

  - String
  - Unique
  - Required
  - Trimmed

- `email`

  - String
  - Required
  - Unique
  - Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

- `thoughts`

  - Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

- `friends`
  - Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

---

**Thought**:

- `thoughtText`

  - String
  - Required
  - Must be between 1 and 280 characters

- `createdAt`

  - Date
  - Set default value to the current timestamp
  - Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

- `username` (The user that created this thought)

  - String
  - Required

- `reactions` (These are like replies)
  - Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

- `reactionId`

  - Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  - Default value is set to a new ObjectId

- `reactionBody`

  - String
  - Required
  - 280 character maximum

- `username`

  - String
  - Required

- `createdAt`
  - Date
  - Set default value to the current timestamp
  - Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

## API Routes

**`/api/users`**

- `GET` all users

- `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

- `POST` a new user:

  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

- `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

- `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

- `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

- `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

- `GET` to get all thoughts

- `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

- `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

- `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

- `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**
